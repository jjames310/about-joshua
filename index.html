    <h3 style = "font-family:courier,arial,helvetica;">I was born in Jacksonville,Florida. I'm 25 years old. I love to <br> workout and basically stay physically active in my <br>
        free time I find it a natural stress reliever. <br> I'm of mixed race, black and italian. Another thing I
        love is the beach <br> unfortunately there is just lakes and rivers here in New Mexico. A <br> core belief of mine
        is <span>everything happens for a reason and you should <br> never give up hope no matter what situation you
            are in.</span>
