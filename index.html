<h1>About-Josh <h1/>

<h2>I was born in Jacksonville,Florida. I'm 25 years old. I love to workout and basically stay physically active in my
free time I find it a natural stress reliever. I'm of mixed race, black and italian. Another thing I
love is the beach, unfortunately there is just lakes and rivers here in New Mexico. A core belief of mine
    is everything happens for a reason and you should never give up hope no matter what situation you
    are in.<h2/>
