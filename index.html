<h1 style="background-color: blue;"> About-Josh <h1/>

    <h2>I was born in Jacksonville,Florida. I'm 25 years old. I love to <br> workout and basically stay physically active in my <br>
        free time I find it a natural stress reliever. <br> I'm of mixed race, black and italian. Another thing I
        love is the beach, <br> unfortunately there is just lakes and rivers here in New Mexico. A <br> core belief of mine
        is everything happens for a reason and you should <br> never give up hope no matter what situation you
        are in.<h2/>
